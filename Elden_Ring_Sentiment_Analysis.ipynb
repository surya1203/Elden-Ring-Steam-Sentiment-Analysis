no, i don ’ t want to explore yet another cave or a mine or some lazily copy pasted catacomb (sometimes with a chariot ), but sometimes you have to, to get the smithing stones or that talisman you want but it ’ s not just the dungeons that get copy pasted, bosses and enemies do too can you imagine my disappointment when i got to the mountaintops of giants and was like \" holy, this area is so beautiful, i wonder what kind of enemies i \\' ll be fighting in here \" can you imagine my face when i saw the caelid dogs, the caelid birds, the stormveil birds, the demi - humans, the bats, the marionettes, the men, and the vulgar militiamen a - at least zamor dudes became a normal enemy instead of a m - mini - boss, so it \\' s at least ONE unique enemy tied to this area, r - right? miyazaki, my brother in christ, I HAVE BEEN FIGHTING THESE ANNOYING BIRDS AND BATS AND DOGS THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE GAME, I ’ VE KILLED SO MANY OF THE DEFAULT SWORD / SPEAR SOLDIERS, CAN YOU PLEASE ADD MORE ENEMIES INTO THE GAME NO, YOU CAN ’ T JUST PASTE OLD ENEMIES FROM OLD GAMES, YOU DID THAT TWICE IN ELDEN RING ALREADY WITH ASYLUM DEMON AND CAPRA DEMON i am especially sick of the transcript pasted dragons, erdtree avatars are at least fun to fight ROT DRAGON, ICE DRAGON, NORMAL DRAGON, MAGIC DRAGON, MAGIC DRAGON 2 ALL OF THEM HAVE THE SAME MOVESET this is a triple a game, just to remind you edit: there is way more copy paste from previous titles as it turns out, just today i found out about red wolf of radagon having the same animations as sif and the death blight frogs> combat this is where things get bad, such outdated souls - tier combat where it feels like you ’ re handling a bus instead of a human SHOULD NOT EXIST with such fast bosses that feel like they come straight out of sekiro either make the player faster and give him more movement options, or make the bosses slower it is infuriating having to dodge 5 - 10 boss attacks only to get ONE hit in and then repeat the cycle torrent is awful to control, and it feels like he \\' s not listening to half my commands wow, it \\' s just like a real horse! the decision to make your stamina tied to torrent \\' s is also bizarre and unexplainable also, input buffering is more often then not the result of your character ’ s demise, as it has been countless times that this trash read my ash of war as ash of war + left handed attack after it and i died so many times because of this before fromdrones shout “ skill issue ”, i am literally putting my hands off the keyboard after doing the ash tree of war and my character still does the normal attack after it but, despite that, my character drinks only 1 flask half the time despite me mashing the heal button i often miss the opportunity to reposte thanks to INPUT BUFFERING, so why not let the player know when the boss stagger is coming up? you \\' re gonna make a posture break mechanic without implementing at least some kind of sign? i swear to christ miyazaki has never played his own games also, why do the enemies \\' arrows home in on you, yet the player \\' s arrows don \\' t home in on enemies? do the enemies have special magnet arrows or something? can some lore expert tell me how this is explained in the story?> bosses and these bosses, oh god, these bosses delayed attacks, input reads (these are especially “ fun ” if you ’ re doing any run that involves projectiles ), blatant destruction of established game mechanic, they got everything you don ’ t want in an action rpg and i can \\' t stress enough how awful the input reads are, the best bosses for showcasing such nonsense are margit for his combo extender that he won \\' t do unless you attack and the godskins who shoot black flames at you IMMEDIATELY upon pressing the heal button someone needs to teach miyazaki that \\' s not how reaction time works but, being completely honest, i had fun fighting malenia sure, she is actually one to break established mechanics https: / / www. youtube. com / watch? v = R9Vbsr3Ko7M but at least that boss has a unique feel and dynamic to it, akin to an old samurai standoff, where the two warriors exchange blows and then fall back to circle around each other her attacks are more or less intuitive, and she does have a flexible moveset that ’ s fun to play around with on your part EXCEPT FOR WATERFOWL DANCE AND VAMPIRISM, WHOEVER DESIGNED THOSE INTO MALENIA NEEDS TO GET FIRED FROM THEIR JOB ASAP, AND UNLESS YOU ’ VE NOT DONE SOMETHING AS ELEMENTARY AS BEATING MALENIA ON A KEYBOARD WITH NO SUMMONS OR SLEEP POTS OR MOONVEIL / ROB, YOUR OPINION DOES NOT COUNT also, elden beast is the worst final boss in any video game ever, radagon was such a good conclusion to this mediocre, but still charming game, but nope, my face gets smeared with the broken unfun mess that is elden beast he \\' s constantly running away, he \\' s not at all dynamic like radagon, and he even looks like crap come on, who wants to fight a giant space spaghetti as the final boss? also, ulcerated tree spirit just ulcerated tree spirit> story average fromsoft fan be like: OH MY SCIENCE IS THAT LE HECKING MIYAZAKI TELLING THE LORE OF THE GAME THROUGH ITEM DESCRIPTIONS FOR THE 1488TH TIME? ?? HOLY GOSH OOOOOOOOOOO ELDEN RING seriously though, the lore of this game is admittedly pretty interesting, but the narrative sucks to give an example, in the beginning we are shown a literal powerpoint presentation about the world okay, what ’ s the night of the black knives? not gonna explain? oh, okay i ’ m a tarnished? i don ’ t even understand what that means what the hell is an elden ring? and so on and so forth stuff similar this continues throughout the whole game because the narrative feels like a jumbled mess of in - universe terms and seemingly random events on that note, quest design in this game is unintuitive as hell to take varre ’ s pursuance for instance, how the hell am i supposed to know that i need invade other players THREE times to advance his quest? or patches, it ’ s like he ’ s teleporting around the map at random, he doesn ’ t tell you where he ’ s gonna go> leveling softcaps? truly? at least tell the player when they get to them, so he doesn ’ t have to google it i suggest this is due to pvp or some crap like that, but pvp is a portion of the game, not the entirety of it and you don ’ t balance stuff AROUND it the smithing stone grind in this game is obnoxious because of what i described about the caves in the open world section such game design is almost ubisoft - tier, and those are the items that actually get you through the game> optimization it is just bad it is understandable why my fps are bad on medium settings, seeing distant lands is part of the charm of this game but the crashes are inexcusable i suspect it is due to the botched anti - cheat, since without steam this game didn \\' t run half as bad IN CONCLUSION i really cannot recommend this game if you \\' re into the ACTION part of the ACTION RPGs it \\' s a strong MAYBE if you \\' re into the RPG part, but it \\' s just simply so tiresome to even control your character this game is just outdated, through and through, and i think we all know why it won goty it is because there was nothing else better than elden ring i mean, come on, you \\' re gonna give it to god of soy? miyazaki is a hack',\n",

They ' ve essentially taken Dark Souls 3 and slapped it into an open - world. My biggest gripe with the game is they ' ve seemingly made the game hard just for the sake of being hard. Information technology seems like most enemies, especially bosses, are all running at Bloodborne speed (with 360 gymnastics, jump all over the place, infinite stamina, spamming combos, crazy damage) while the player character is running at Dark Souls 1 speed. Gone is the challenging yet fair game - play of their former games. My second gripe is the open - world facial expression. It ' s so boring! There ' s non enough in it to actually research, so you ' re essentially just running from one major area to another, with a few bits and pieces in between. The atmosphere and the look of the world is great though. Elden Ring would ' ve benefited so much more from proper interconnected world design.

              " 'NOTE: I played this game at launch. It \\' s okay. This review will compare Elden Ring to Dark Souls III a lot for obvious reasons. The open world formula hurts this game a lot. A sense of bewilderment is common when you move around with barely any direction at all. You get indications to sites of grace, but that \\' s it. When i tried going someplace interesting on my ain i got stomped instantly. If i didn \\' t explore the crevices of the vast empty land, i was under leveled. If i explored everything then i saw the same ruins asset and enemies scattered everywhere. It felt like a grind and exploration for the sake of exploration. When i moved on to the \" correct \" path, and there certainly is one, although the game nor the players tell you that, it all felt very good. The pacing was amazing. This harkens back to my previous statement; when the developer guides you in and puts you through the curated experience (i. e you play it like Dark Souls ternion ), it \\' s really, really good. When you actually do open world content, it actually kind of sucks. A huge flaw in design for me is the way they introduce you this danger. Spoilers: There is a point in the game where you get transported from the starting zone, to a much higher story Zone, Caelid. It \\' s very obvious you are supposed to, and should, run. So i did. I got to a site of grace and went back home. This is introduced if you enter an obscure cave with a chest at the end. The run where i didn \\' t do this, and entered as i normally would with Torrent, i got stomped by the enemies and lost my runes. Therefore, it \\' s apparent to me that the game is induce to be explored and scoured for treasure. However, this content is repetitive. The same reused caves and bosses are littered across the map and give you cool stuff. The enemies here are annoying and the same in all of them, with varying layouts. Completing these is mostly a chore you do to unlock things. Not once did i do a dungeon and find it a refreshing or interesting experience. Oh, and if you skip all these you will likely be under leveled and miss out on all the cool stuff. Following the curated experience is expert. I wish they had taken more steps to gently guide you in game instead so they could lean into what they answer best, the \" dancing \" with the bosses. Dark Souls 3 had exquisite combat flow and each boss had a built - in rythm to learn, with few exceptions (looking at you, Oceiros ). The satisfaction from completely dismantling a boss by learning their every move was amazing. It truly felt like you rose from the ashes and became stronger by learning every time. The bosses in Elden Ring attack you so mercilessly that you offload some hits to your summons instead or just abuse magic so you avoid the combat. The openings you gain be therefore the boss attacking your meatshield instead of your own skill dodging their attacks and abusing these openings, especially if you use heavy weapons. I repeat, the intended way to play the game is by not interacting with the boss. To see the anthisesis of this, and my ideal version of the game, look at the Iudex Gundyr or Dragonslayer Armor fight from Dark Souls 3. To summarize, I feel the design around summons and the bosses are poorly done. Removing summons in boss fights, if not altogether, would drastically improve the game. There is no option to not use summons unless you want to use exploits, metagame or otherwise play OP builds, and not what you find fun. The weapons and ashes of war are good. The combat is better with more variation and more moves to learn. The progression is there. TL; DR The game is okay, but at last dissapointing coming from Dark Souls 3.

              " 'I \\' ve been an avid action rpg player since I was a kid, starting with Phantasy Star Online on the Dreamcast. In 2022 and 2023 I played a lot of Splatoon 3, Monster Hunter Rise, and am more recently Playing Risk of Rain 2, Valheim, and Deep Rock Galactic. All of these games I listed have superb combat and very fitting combat. They feel honest, they \\' re fun, and I find all of these games to control in an enjoyable way. By that, I mean that they have excellent gameplay. Elden Ring \\' s gameplay feel and loop are very poor. The controls and gameplay itself have offered me the least fun that I have ever had in an action rpg game. Now, before you begin harassing me in claims that I just don \\' t like \" difficult \" games, I found that Elden Ring is one of the least punishing action rpgs I have ever played. If you are spending your runes, as you should, then death in this game is literally not a problem at all and there is no reason to fear dying. So punishing is definitely not a term I would use. \" Difficult \" is somewhat of a subjective term, but what I am assuming players mean by \" difficult \" in this context is not \" difficult \", but actually tedious. You really only have about 3 things that you might do: One is to dodge, dodge, dodge, and of course to dodge again and again. The main gameplay loop is to continually dodge poor optimized, in terms of time, attacks. The key to not getting hit is to time your dodge, but if you play this game or watch gameplay, there are so many times when you expect to get hit but don \\' t or expect not to get hit but do. Ultimately, this leads to nothing more than spamming the dodge button like a madman as a go around to this issue. And that ultimately leads to boring gameplay. The second thing you might do is attack. Attacks are done on a controller using the R1 and R2 triggers. The R2 trigger gives you a kind of charge attack or a slower but heavier hit. However, as we talked about timing issues, R2 is just far too impractical to even bother using with a basic melee weapon. It is better to get your poke in with an R1 then run, or rather, to continue your dodge - athon. Which leads me into explaining why this is so terribly boring. You are spending most time avoiding combat and being disengaged for one, but more importantly, there isn \\' t a lot of action coming from the player, or combos, or effects that might compromise the opponent, or disable them, or lead to giving the player some kind of advantage due to their fight strategy and so forth. The action part of the action combat is the role player running and evading a barrage of attacks or projectiles from an enemy combatant. Sure there are tour and you can summon pets or something to spice things up, but if you want to play, or rather, engage in combat, your access to participate in the process of action within this ACTION rpg are incredibly limited. The third main thing that might comprise your gameplay is using items, which would be a bomb, or a heal potion, or mana potion, whatever you are carrying with you. These potions are your main source of healing or mana rejuvenation and you will be using them a lot to continue your combat participation. However, there is a very very big problem with this system. You want to make sure that you have the item you may need to use on the fly as your selected item because you do non want to have to change active items during combat, as the joystick that controls your sprite is separate from the joystick to change items, which would be your d - pad. Now, strategically this adds excitement into what would be otherwise very boring gameplay, due to the strategy of selecting items before engaging or running away so you can switch to your mana potion to continue casting spells, or whatever, but the real problem here is that you are literally taking control off of your character in order to access your items. The shift of item requires a letting go of control of your character and creates a back and forth of engagement and disengagement. Monster Hunter does this too with their item system, but in the case of Monster Hunter it has very little effect on your ability to continue engagement in the battle. You can wire bug and dive back in. In Elden Ring you dodge like a madman, get far far away, then switch items or heal or whatever, then dodge dodge your way back in. It \\' s simply tedious and tedious and this is because your sprite completely lacks mobility. And, Monster Hunter does not make you feel like you are giving up control of your character to access items. In sum, there are better games out there. The popularity of this game just goes to show that it is not quality that people desire but to be a part of the popular. The best I could give this game is a 7 / 10 and even that 7 seems overly generous. The combat is boring, does not feel rewarding, makes you feel gimped and weak (not in a positive way ), discourages engagement, and is severely lacking in complexity or technique. Defeating an enemy gives you no satisfaction due to anything you have done and simply leaves you with an empty feeling of relief. I would not recommend this game to anyone.',\n",

              " 'Note: This is not strictly a negative review, but the game ’ s overall design makes it hard for me to openly recommend it. Elden Ring is an open world combat RPG, where battling with enemies is the center of everything. There is a huge world to explore where you find various items, that help your character you make in the beginning to become stronger statistically, but everything you find centers on your combat capableness of course, since this is not an adventure game. Albeit this approach, the game offers some impressive vistas throughout the world you explore, somewhat curious NPCs that talk to you and most importantly challenges in the form of varying enemies and boss battles. There are many places you can visit, also underground, which all help you, at the end of the day, to become stronger by giving you more runes, that are basically a currency you buy levels with at checkpoints. If one is familiar with the developer ’ s, From Software, former titles, the risk reward mechanic is the same in here and the actual fighting mechanics are also the same as in Dark Souls games; you lose your runes when you die, but can retrieve them from your death spot, but lose them completely if you die again before that, and the fighting is basically careful observing of enemies while dodging (by rolling endlessly) and blocking. The game is fun at the beginning, offering decent challenge, and at any point if you find the game too tough, which is likely, you can gain more levels by collecting runes for slaying enemies or simply exploring easier approachable areas. Since the game is very long in length due to the sheer size of the world, most players might wish to follow the main path straight to the end without much additional exploration, but alas, the game ’ s difficulty, even despite the help of a selectable phantom fighter (spirit ashes) who you can call in for help in tough spots, forces exploration to gain runes for the vast majority of players to overcome later tough enemies. This might not sound like an issue, since this applies to some other open world titles too, but the time it takes to explore to be strong enough is in tens of hours – I ’ m not exaggerating. While the beginning is fun and quite exciting, the more you play the more repetition kicks in, even if the areas around the map are visually different, but enemies repeat and so do bosses; they use the same models. Even the overall quality of level design is better at the beginning, the Stormveil Castle being at least to me the most exciting place to see and explore, after that perhaps a few notable places existing in the game. This castle is at the very beginning and after that the quality slowly drops the further you get, endgame being very tough and a slog to get through, mostly due to some nasty bosses. The bosses are a big part of the studio ’ s focus and they are admittedly often fun to fight, but in this game most bosses are annoyingly designed, scaling in damage too much from the very beginning till the end. This vast damage they tend to inflict in a single strike makes the game more a hectic rhythm based act to avoid the worst hits, while waiting patiently for an opening to strike pretty much freely when the enemy takes it ’ s pause. I find this limiting character building wise, since I ’ m sure the game is extremely hard without putting many skill points on vitality (max health) to sustain more damage. The bosses also have cheap moves and combos, which often truly makes you feel like you die an unexpected and unfair death, but this is thankfully mitigated by the phantom helper that can take hits from enemies instead of you and even slightly damage them, so you can heal up on the side, perhaps cast a spell or incantation and prepare to strike again. So even if boss design is most often not as great as in previous games from the studio, especially compared to Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, occasionally being even bad, the phantom helper is there for you making some bosses actually pretty trivial, which is not a bad thing if you don ’ t wish to be stuck on them in this - in my honest opinion - too long game. I personally have explored almost everything in the world and I ’ m likely ” over leveled ”, which would mean that in the main progression path I ’ m fighting enemies on a higher level than players usually are, but still, after playing so long, easily over 100 hours in fact, I ’ m still currently momentarily stuck at one mandatory very late game boss that, once again, has upped damage so that it can kill you in a short sweep of attacks. This fact is saddening to me, since the game has pretty fun exploration, the best yet character building in the studio ’ s history, amusing places to discover, and of course the action is intuitive and most often entertaining, but yet the game is enough of a slog to get through at many points and too repetitive. If you decide or rather need to explore much because of the difficulty that can spike, the game starts undoubtedly to feel overall as following: cheap. It is a cheap game in the end with talent and quality at many places, but filler content and bad design all over the place. This game should have been shorter in my opinion, or at least easy enough to complete quicker going straight through the main path, but for me - and I ’ m not a noob mind you since I have completed Dark Souls 1 and 3 and Sekiro, Elden Ring is simply too tough to my taste to call it enjoyable. As a side note, I might find the game so hard due to a faith build, meaning I use incantations in the game that are slow to cast in the heat of a battle, but this fact just tarnishes the game even more, because it truly doesn ’ t allow too much freedom in building the character if you want to excel as care free as possible - which you want, trust me. Now you might find this game fun and most players looking for combatting challenge will do at the beginning for a long while, but I label this review as negative due to the overall quality throughout the experience and the too cheap and frustrating challenge you will face eventually, no matter how good you are. If you are good, you will overcome the challenge, perhaps even quickly, but I doubt many of the fights are that fun in any case, unlike in Dark Souls 3 for example, where the game is thoroughly quite carefully designed, albeit unforgiving. Consider this game if you constitute ready to face this disappointment I ’ m feeling here and in the case you are a fan of the studio ’ s previous work, but for many, you should think twice, remembering that this game is far from GOTY material like some might claim, because the lineament is so varying. I think sound design and graphics should be better as well to call this a GOTY, since the tech is like a mix of last - gen and current - gen, leaning more on the last - gen. Lastly about the mentioned technical side: The game runs decent enough if you have strong single core CPU performance and my RX 5700 XT plays it almost always at 60 FPS on max settings at 1440p, which the game is unfortunately capped at, but this hasn ’ t bothered me mentionably. There are sphere that are bound to drop the framerate below 60 FPS, somewhere around 40 – 45, which is a slight annoyance, but those moments are rare. The game ’ s current version 1. 08. 1 is bug free, though it ’ s worth to mention that I experienced one freeze - up. Enjoy, suffer, be numbed, overcome, that is the formula of Elden Ring.

              " 'Ignore the hype, ignore you \\' re friends, don \\' t bother playing this game. REQUIRES AT LEAST 10 hours of tutorial videos on builds, basic game mechanics, and side quests that exist in the game before actually playing. The game does not teach you anything about how to play it, you need to rely on outside help in order to progress. This includes basic things like how to navigate the menu, how to create a strong character, which weapons to use, etc. The difficulty curve is set up so that you NEED to learn these things early on, else you will not progress in the game. To start off, here is the entire plot to the game: you want to be elden lord, maybe. That \\' s it. Some characters are more or less keen on that, but it \\' s not really clear. Most of the lore and \" narrative \" of the game can be found in item descriptions, and its the most ineffectual way to tell a story that I have ever encountered. Side missions have zero logic to them, basically you need to talk to every NPC in the game in order to progress a mission without referencing a guide or tutorial. Most missions have a point where you grab some item like \" the sacred toenail of Ira the dancer \" and for some reason you are supposed to know that \" Ephesius \" needs that to make it to Narnia or some nonsense like that. Many of these side missions are necessary to beat the game at a reasonable difficulty level, else you will be under leveled or poorly equipped to face required bosses. Honestly I can \\' t talk about this game without referencing the menu, it is the most poorly organized, laziest feature to any video game I have ever played. This studio has had an entire decade to hone the menuing system in their RPG game, and the best thing they can come up with is a literal grab bag of items organized like a pile of clothes on a teenagers dorm room floor. I cannot distinguish you how many times I grabbed an item only to never use it in my play - through simply because I lost it in the menu. There is a lantern in this game, and I have to play Where \\' s Waldo every single time I try to equip it simply because I picked something up on the ground in an open world RPG game, and it reshuffled my items. Gameplay wise, its a souls game. That is to say, its a rhythm game that tries to cheese you every step of the way. In some fashion, I find this rewarding, especially when facing groups of enemies in the games various dungeons. Assuming you have min / maxed your character to make the fight doable of course. Most of these encounters are well set up to challenge you to figure out a strategy to beat them consistently, given limited space and resources. Unfortunately, this is an open world game, and the majority of encounters occur in the open world. In these cases, it is easy to bypass encounters by going around them, or fighting them one on one. To make up for that, the game designers added lots of harder enemies that are required fights for one reason or another. All of these fights devolve into \" big guy with sword in field \" or \" big guy with axe in field \", and have basically the same move sets. The best way to deal with them is to grind levels until you can easily combo or one shot them, otherwise you \\' re in for repetitive, uninspired fights. A majority of enemies are direct copy pastes of one another, and it \\' s a shame. It \\' s a shame because the art might represent the best I give seen in a video game. There are many biomes / areas to explore, and each their own unique artistic style to them. You can easily tell which area you are in just by the art style of the world around you. I visited every single area in this game simply because I wanted to explore the environment that the artists created, and I put up with all of repetitive gameplay and the obnoxious bosses to do it. The bosses in this game suffer the same issue as the enemies. At least half are re - used throughout the game, the worst example being used at least 6 times. Many of them share similar move - sets as well, making the artistically unique bosses seem like copies of earlier ones. Put simply, fighting them is a chore. The bigger, \" demigod \" bosses are more unique, at least early in the game. But more often than not, they can only be defeated by a \" normal \" player by cheesing them. Multiple times in this game I have been impressed by a boss design, only to realize the best way to defeat them is an unsatisfying cheese that the game gives you as an apology for making their boss unbeatable at the level you are supposed to face them. Towards the end of the game, it becomes a boss rush, and there are no more cheese strategies available. In order to beat these, you need to enter into an hours long gameplay loop of getting one shot to each combo they throw out so you can learn the precise moment you need to dodge in order to avoid their attacks. If you grind hard enough, you can eventually see the ending to a game with zero story. I played this game because a friend recommended it. They said they enjoyed it, and they hoped I did too, and then apologized for telling me I should play it. Many people on here have the same story, and many of their friends say they enjoyed the game as well. The only explanation I can come up with is that this game is Type 2 fun. When you are in the moment, playing the game, its terrible. Once you are done, and you \\' ve completed it, the feeling of accomplishment you get overshadows those moments of frustration, the monotony of grinding, and the times you left the game defeated. You commiserate with your friends, and it becomes a shared experience that you can connect with. Eventually you forget the negative feelings you had while playing the game, and the memories that persist are those of the adventure you embarked on, and the feeling of growth that came out of it. But when I play this game, I can \\' t help merely wonder what I actually am supposed to get out of it. I pressed dodge the exact millisecond I needed to five times in a row, and won a boss encounter because of it. Was that worth it? Is practicing this one button press for an hour straight really what I \\' m doing with my time? More than anything, thing game makes me question why I spend time playing it instead of doing something else. The first encounter in Elden Ring is with a hulking mass of thrashing bodies, congealed in a spider like blob of legs and arms. If it is your first playthrough, it easily dispatches you with a few swipes of its relatively tiny sword, shrugging off any damage you attempt to inflict. Veteran players, expecting the monster, can beat it with well timed dodges and strikes, though it is no easy feat. The reward for doing so is a short walk to a nearby pathway, where the ground gives out, killing you instantly. The same can be said for the game as a whole. No matter what you do, the end result is the same, you get nothing for your time, your energy, your frustration. In the end, it is a futile waste of effort. Go read a book instead.',\n",

              " 'It \\' s been two and a half months now since I 100% \\' ed this game. I haven \\' t had the urge to go back to it a single time since. I didn \\' t hate the time I spent with it, but I wouldn \\' t say I enjoyed it either. I have never played a FromSoftware game before – whenever I saw someone play one of their Souls - games Iodine thought \" Wow that looks absolutely horrible and about as fun as going to the dentist. \" And I didn \\' t necessarily mean the difficulty (and more specifically the way in which they are \" difficult \" ), but also the aesthetics and how the movement and physics looked like. But, given the absolutely insane hype levels for Elden Ring I decided to finally give one of them a shot. Unfortunately my intuition was correct: The movement does feel like you \\' re controlling a semi truck on molasses. It just does not * feel * fun to do anything in this game, be it running around or fighting. I \\' m not talking about the way heavy vs. light loadouts feel, the very foundations of movement and physics in this game just don \\' t appeal to me. Of course as a Souls - beginner it also took some getting used to, but that happened fairly quickly. I didn \\' t have any trouble with it, but it \\' s not something that would draw me to the game – which is problematic, considering that movement makes up most of the gameplay. The other part, the aesthetics, also mostly didn \\' t click for me just as I expected. Don \\' t get me wrong, I can appreciate that the art direction in this game is very well done. (I do think that it \\' s a tad bit overhyped, though – the game looks good, but it doesn \\' t look great.) But with very few exceptions information technology is all just pain and despair, mud and dirt, darkness and gloom. There \\' s not enough contrast between areas that are some variation of \" big end of the world mood \" and more light - hearted areas. I understand that this makes sense from a story perspective, but it \\' s just not something I enjoy very much. Why would I want to spend 100 + hours in this utterly depressing hellscape, with no respite to make it all worth it? Speaking of story … well. It certainly has some GRRM aspects to it, but not so much the good ones that gave us amazing stories well over a decade ago, but the ones that just drip feed the idea of something bigger and better still to come, pinky promise, anytime now! If you \\' re lucky enough to even stumble upon some story, it \\' s usually confusing and feels irrelevant / disconnected. I hate modern Ubisoft open world games as much as anyone else, but Elden Ring absolutely does not even come close to do this right in the way that Breath of the Wild did. The fact that most players will go to a Wiki to be able to work out out how to finish (or even find and begin …) quest lines is a scathing indictment of how badly the game fails at telling its stories. The \" async coop \" did not click with me either. The ghosts of other players pretty much ne\\'er revealed anything of interest to me. At best they could be ignored, at worst they were a distraction. Far worse are the hints, which gives a pretty good insight into the headspace of the fan base of this game. \" try finger but hole \" is their idea of peak comedy, and everyone falls over themselves making this same joke for the billionth time. More serious ones like \" enemy / treasure ahead \" are worthless as well, because you can never know if it is a troll or not. So you do check any nooks and crannies anyway – and there \\' s nothing wrong with a game wanting you to do and then, but what \\' s the point of these hints then. Finally, the difficulty. Yeah, it \\' s pretty hard if you don \\' t farm XP and overlevel yourself. The game does an okay job of being a difficult game. Considering that it \\' s a fairly complex 3D open world game, you can \\' t expect great loading times after you die, but the gameplay also isn \\' t designed for dying as often and freely as for example something like Celeste – which lets you continue playing after death within milliseconds. There \\' s a couple of spots that are just infuriating, though, mostly to do with elevators. Site of grace next to the elevator, you ride it up and there \\' s an area where you most likely will die a whole bunch of times before getting through. Every damn time after dying and respawning at the site of grace you not only have to ride back up – you first have to call the elevator back down because it is still above from your earlier ride. Of course that is logical and \" correct \", but that doesn \\' t make it any less annoying. Resetting an elevator next to a site of grace to be on your level upon respawning would have been such an obvious QoL improvement, but Elden Ring does not give you any of those. And hardcore fans will defend that as realism, or a counter to the oh so horrible hand - holding that games do these days. But that \\' s bs. Little annoyances like that don \\' t make a game harder or \" more real \", they just make it more annoying. It \\' s these kinds of things that make me think that Elden Ring was rushed out in the end, and I \\' m genuinely baffled by the praise it gets for supposedly being \" one of the good ones \" when compared to other AAA games and their need for twenty four hours one patches. Iodine didn \\' t _mind_ the stuttering issues the game still has on PC, but they haven \\' t even been fixed. I had _a ton_ of bugs and glitches and some crashes even. Nothing too bad or unexpected for a game of this scale, but Elden Ring is not some magic outlier here that does things much better or differently than other good AAA games, of which there is still plenty. So, do I recommend this game? No, I personally do not. If your taste in games is like mine, you won \\' t enjoy it very much. I don \\' t regret my time with information technology, because now I know definitively that Souls - games just aren \\' t for me. But that thumbs - down is not meant to say that it \\' s a bad game, despite all my criticisms above. A lot of them are very subjective, and the ones that I \\' d say are a bit more objective aren \\' t dragging the game down too much. I can absolutely understand why people love this game, but unfortunately I didn \\' t.',\n",

It ' s as wide as an ocean and shallow as a puddle. I prefer the old linear experience that Dark Souls has always provided. I also stand that I wish we could get back to the inter connectivity that DS1 demonstrated so excellently. I become incredibly disappointed when I clear a side dungeon only to fight a boss I previously killed. It ruins the excitement of finding something new only to experience something old. The reuse of bosses in this game kills the experience for me. The boss design is as well another cistron in my review. I ' ve always been a hyper aggressive player. I look for openings in between attacks while still being able to turn over dodging as well. I ' m aggressive and hate playing passive. I enjoy optimizing and looking for zero downtime if possible. That said, these bosses will string together a Marvel Vs Capcom string for 30 seconds and I ' m just stuck standing away and looking at the boss like I ' m stupid. After that string they have almost zero downtime and begin to run the string once again. It ' s not fun to constantly be dodging for 30 + second only to maybe hit once or twice. In closing, we sacrificed quality for quantity. The game has the highest highs of the series followed by devastatingly low lows that ruin it for me.\",\n",

I personally have no idea about this stuff tbh, but I frequently heard about meta builds being broken or nessassary to defeat harder bosses, PVP - builds all being the same, etc. This hurts the integrity and one of the best aspects of the game: play however you want. Point proven: Elon Musk literally got flamed and people wrote articles about him for using an \" off - meta \" frame. wtf? I \\' m HEAVILY discouraged of doing so, because X is most broken, , Y is nessassary to beat stuff or, going to my next point, I levelled Z. Limitation: Some limitation is very good and welcomed. However I REALLY dislike how weapons and Arts are Stat - Locked. How come I defeat the X - Dungeon or boss, wasting hard - earned Stone - Keys to play them, just to come out with a lackluster experience and a weapon I can \\' t use? This feels genuinely HORRIBLE. Yes, I \\' ve been told I can respec, but 1) I have literally no idea how (feeling lost ), and 2) I can do this only a limited amount of times. And no, I don \\' t want to REPLAY the entirety of Elden Ring because, and this is the singular reason my friends replay this game, I want to try a new build. This seems INSANE to me. It \\' s unfair: Some Bosses and Mobs felt very unfun to play against (don \\' t get me started about this invisible dude ). I don \\' t really want to waste 6 hours for the TUTORIAL BOSS. So what did my friends act? (this was one of the biggest mistakes I \\' ve done ); we cheesed a Mob way beyond my league (but accessible for some reason; that doesn \\' t make sense ), giving me an INSANE amount of Levels. I \\' ve become overlevelled to the point where I still first - try bosses 40 hours into it. As a Newbie to Souls - Games. That doesn \\' t feel right nor fun. Hearing that the lategame gets worse, with frequently more unfair enemies, I feel very discouraged to go on. I came into Elden Ring and wanted a \" Hard but Fair \" game, but this couldn \\' t be further from what I \\' ve experienced. Story: I literally have no Idea why I play this game on a story - perspective. I know I want to be this Elden Lord, go to that Tree or whatever, but that \\' s about it. The only reason I kept playing is because I want to find special places, see something I didn \\' t see before. It comes down to everything feeling VERY confusing. I have this quest where I needed to go down a well to find some NPC. The Well - part was rather easy, but down there and without guidence by my friends I would \\' ve probably searched for a bit - then I found him and CAN \\' T EVEN PROCEED this questline. \" The next part is out of my reach for some time \" my friends tell me, seeing no problem with that. Multiplayer: Multiplayer was a mistake. It \\' s frequently laggy, It takes AGES to play together, it \\' s very limited and there are exploits that feel like straight up cheating. This shouldn \\' t be the way you play this game imo. PVP is also very unfun, running into the same builds a lot of times (\" YO It \\' s another Guts - Build \" - my friends shout in exitement ). This is a personal point to be fair, but let it be mentioned here. This game is far better enjoyed in Single Player. This is where I stand: I intentionally didn \\' t go deep into the positives to try out my point but trust me: This game got GREAT things going for it. That \\' s why I \\' ll keep playing after all. It \\' second far better than many Triple A titles (which is not hard to be fair ). I first thought Souls - Games are just not my type of game, but I \\' ve disproven that by liking other souls - games I \\' ve played recently. I \\' ve truely thought I \\' m a noob, that the game is too hard because. .. well. .. I \\' m too bad. But that wasn \\' t true aswell. I \\' ve finally stopped giving it the benefit of the doubt, \" breaking my silence \" one might say, and saw it for what is it: A great game with huge deal - breakers and impossible problems to solve. It \\' s near impossible to play this game without any help, it lacks direction, multiplayer is bad, the story is a confusing mess, the Open World hurts the game more than it does good. This game is far from being the masterpiece people praise it to be.

              " 'Given all the hype this game received, well, eventually I should probably learn to not trust \" professional \" game reviewers. I \\' m not sure if this is the studio \\' s first open world game, but it sure feels like it. It \\' s a bland and boring (but beautiful) world with no direction and incredibly repetitive mechanics that become boring after the second dungeon you go through. You don ’ t need direction in a linear game like sinister souls (rather, its linear nature IS the direction ). But open world games demand at least some of it. Given all the hidden secrets in this world, I can tell just how much effort the devs put into crafting it. But with how they just point you in a vague direction and say “ go kill that boss to advance! ”, they utterly fail their lovingly crated world by not giving the user any real reason to explore it. I saw a lot of reviewers saying that you should use a notepad with this game to keep track of side quests because there is not quest log. If your players are having to use external tools to observe track of something in the game, that ’ s a failing on the game ’ s part. It does not add to the experience or mystique of the game. In fact, it detracts, since you have to consciously put the game aside to take notes. One didn ’ t get far enough into the game to really pronounce how much you ’ d have to use the wiki to find secrets and solve puzzles, but if what little I did get is an indication of the rest of the game, then another symptom of the lack of direction is just how often people have to search online to figure out how to find something or what to do next. Again, if your players are have to use external tools to play the game, it ’ s a failing of the game. I \\' ve yet to find any appreciable story after 15 hours of play. And no, a few lines of dialogue every now and then are NOT story. They \\' re a pathetic attempt to pretend to have a story. Maybe if I played longer, I \\' d see more interesting content and more story, but if I \\' m not seeing any real story even after I down the first major genus bos, I do not count that as having a account. It \\' s flavor text, at most. As a final note on the negatives: This is a lazy console port. Framerate is capped at 60, Field of View is too narrow for computer screens, and not adjustable. Interface is taken directly from the console, and that \\' s almost never a good thing for a PC game. Control scheme has terrible pre - bound keys, and commands that should really be split between multiple keys on a PC are bound together. Additionally, there are a number of commands that can not be re - bound. Number keys can not be bound to any commands. And there \\' s probably more that I \\' m forgetting about. This game is playable with a kb / mouse, would probably be better with a controller, but REALLY needed a interface / control rework for PC. As for the last part, let me preface this by saying it does NOT factor into my negative review, because I know many people very much so enjoy the souls - like model. This was my first souls like game, and it turns out I do NOT enjoy the punishing mechanics that you have to corpse drag through to learn fights. I get that others do, and I won \\' t review it negatively because of that. Though piece of advice, if you think you won \\' t like the punishing challenge of the souls - like model, do not buy a souls - like game, you \\' ll just be miserable. If you don \\' t have really good reactions, you won \\' t be able to handle combat in this game. People say git gud, and that \\' s the kind of game this is. I just have no interest and do not enjoy it. Again, this is not why I \\' m giving the game a negative review, just a warning to anyone who might be looking to try the souls like model.',\n",

Combat is wearisome going, extremely clunky, and unsatisfying. The gameplay seems to be wandering around and either killing something easily, or dying. Control scheme is reasonable, but inconsistent, and seemingly an afterthought for the PC market. Graphics are average, if not slightly above. The world has some kind of desaturated filter on it that makes everything seem dull. It ' s a blurry mess unless you turn off motion blur and depth of field. The art is good and consistent, which makes up for some of the visual shortcomings of the game. The plot in 2 hrs of play is totally tongue tied. There ' s a lot of exposition in cutscenes without any bearing. The few characters you talk to dialogue dump about what I can only assume matters later. I would consider the piece of writing below average. In 2 hrs of play, I leveled up, which increased some stats that didn ' t wallop anything in a noticeable way of life. I got some armor that increased some stats which also seemingly had no impact. This game reminds me of old dreamcast games from the bargain bin. .

It ' s a battle of attrition of I hit, they hit. And those one - hit kills. Good god. FromSoft really needs to distinguish between difficult and cheap. The stutters and FPS drops are another thing.

              " \"Tl; dr: Read a book or something. If you aren ' t a streamer or unemployed you wont have the time to play this game. Its size makes it a huge slog. Not a good introduction to the Souls Serial and not a good continuation for returning players. If you enjoyed the bosses, you will be dissapointed, their moves are poorly telegraphed. If you enjoyed the multiplayer covenants, you will be dissapointed, covenants were removed, as were worthwhile multiplayer rewards. If you enjoyed the arena matchmaking from DS3 ' s dlc you are in luck, it has made a return and since Elden Ring is relevant you will find arena matches. Go phone your parents or friends or go to a bar drinking, those will fullfill you more then elden ring will. Rant start. Elden Ring expands and streamlines systems from previous games, while showhorning in crafting and an open world. The weapon infusion mechanic combined with the new ashes of war, that allow customisation of a weapons moveset, are great. The invasion multiplayer experience has be neutered, there are no more covenants. The cooperative experience has been streamlined, with a single item ones summon sign now appears all over the game world at certain unlocked summoning pools for other players to find. The rewards for any type of multiplayer? Nonexistant. Multiplayer rewards consist of the equivalent of a humanity / human effigy / ember and something called a furlfinger remedy, an item to reveal summon signs. The furlfinger remedy can also be crafted by mashing together two of the like flower that can be picked from any roadside. Elden Ring has seperated the boosting aspect of a humanity / human effigy / ember from the multiplayer enabling aspect. This results in two severely devalued items. The default reward for multiplayer has as such not changed from previous games, but the percieved value is much lower. The removal of covenants and their unique twist in multiplayer means there are no longer any covenant specific rewards, that could at least act as a trophy. The new open world itself is bloated, to much space, to little substantial reward for exploration. Most exploration rewards are now crafting materials in unsubstantial amounts. Heavy expendable item usage now demands farming for materials from monsters, or prancing around the world picking flowers. There are traders, but not all crafting materials are buyable in unlimited amounts. Want to toss a kilo ton of tnt worth of bombs? Have a fun time farming materials. Want to do a bow only run? Have fun killing small animals for their bone to craft arrows until you find the right merchant. Then farm even more to upgrade those arrows with different effects. Want to use more special arrows? Hit or miss if they are craftable / buyable / must be farmed. The lock - on system is completely unusable. Not a large problem for melee builds, but anything using magic will quickly grow frustrated with the inability to properly focus a target in chemical group fights and switch the lock - on target. Bosses are frantic and unpredictable. Their combat is intense, with every combo being able to chain into the next with little downtime. The boss ai has been ' improved ' meaning some bosses can now read your inputs and toss a fireball into your face, if you go to heal. The combos themselves can also be incredibly dependant on your position with no clear stopping point, meaning that going for a swing from the wrong direction after the combo seemingly ended, can net the player an attack to the face. The percieved weight of a bosses attack can also vary wildly. Perhaps they start their combo with their weapon swinging so quickly that one is hardpressed to react on time, just to suddenly take an awkward pause mid - swing, catchin you off - guard. Elden Ring bosses can be described as experienced pvp players; they only use weapons with incredibly short startup animations, they are masters at input staggering and roll catching and they have deceptive attack ranges. But unlike another player they cannot be staggered in two hits. I can ' t remember where i heard this, but Elden Ring does indeed reward exploration instead of perceverance; exploring the bloated and empty game world eventually nets one enough levels and upgrade materials to overlevel any boss, allowing one to ignore the poorly telegraphed attacks of bosses simply by the means of more healing resources and more damage. In previous games the bosses are consistent enough for the player to gather alot of experience with a bit of perceverance and use that perceverance to finally beat the boss. In Elden Ring the bosses have been ' polished ' to such a degree, have recieved so much love in the form of varying movesets and combos, that i wished the animator in charge of telegraphing those attacks was forced to actually test them first. Being hit by the same high damage move over and over again, because the wind - up animation towards it has so little visual cues it might as well be a rythm game is not fun, its infuriating. Does this mean i am bad at the game? I would agree to that retort, if it weren ' t for the fact that every boss in this game has at least one such attack, an attack with a ridiculous pause mid swing. Every boss, with criminal consistency is guilty of this. Its either you overlevel the boss, or cheese him in some way, or you spend the rest of the year persevering through staggered animations that are meant to uproot any sense of movement coherency you might have learned over your whole life. The open world also quickly looses its novelty after you find another privy place only to be rewarded with a flower you could have just picked from the wayside in larger quantities. Towards the end i quickly rushed through every new area, because i knew that my time was better spent search for anything worthwhile on the wiki and backtrack for it later. It was no longer a game, it was a chore i wanted to be more efficient to hopefully get to the good part. But there is no good part later on. Perhaps the multiplayer could have been a major upside, but there are severe limits on playercount. The world is huge and the game is unable to fill it with either interesting secrets or wothwhile multiplayer. Rant end.\",\n",

I \\' ll keep rage - playing this just so no one can say I didn \\' t give it a chance and I just need to git gud, but I swear I \\' ll update when I \\' ve beat the game that it \\' s still bad. The super punishing boss fights are fun because they \\' re bosses. I will give the game that. I like Monster Hunter, I like Remnant, I like bosses that are really hard. They \\' re incredibly cheap and purposefully designed so, but they \\' re right on the edge of punishing and too cheap, and they \\' re bosses so fine. But for miniboss types or exploring the story path, the basic design of this game is really annoying. If you die when you get to a new enemy type, which you will, CONSTANTLY, then you have to wade through a bunch of mooks who can kill you in three shots by stunlocking you with a buddy, and congrats, now you \\' ve lost all the runes you had on your fucking corpse retrieval. Who does cadaver retrievals still in 2022? So to get to the new enemy you have to play perfectly just to get another shot, but they are all designed with incredibly unpredictable movesets with halting, unnatural moves so you can \\' t predict when to block or dodge. The whole game concept feels like that mario almighty video where every time mario jumps an invisible hazard pops out as an F you. F you, you had no way of knowing this would happen, but now you do. So go back and if you successfully predict that move, awesome, he \\' s got branching paths off the same stance that have equally unpredictable moves. I don \\' t understand why people think dying a ton in holy order to learn a moveset is fun. And again, the moves are designed to be unpredictable. You can \\' t learn your skills and get good at the game and get better, you have to learn each individual enemy type. And it \\' s not just the mechanics of combat that has bad cues, the rest of the game does also. The giant tree knight at the beginning is way too hard to fight. Ok, I understand that after a try or two, but the tutorial, the dude you talk to at the beginning, the tip screens, no one says \" hey, you need to embody careful, don \\' t try to kill everything. \" There are no hints that the bigger something is, the more dangerous it is. There are no hints that if you get stuck, you should go screw around somewhere else and level up, then come back. ALL of that has to be learned through internet research (bad design) or banging your head against the wall so you \\' re frustrated and now have a sour taste in your mouth after owning the game for a few hours. Even like exploring, the game tells you explicitly to follow the glowing paths, but if you do so you \\' ll be incredibly underleveled. So not only do you need to explore the whole section of the map you uncover, you need to go off into gray unexplored sections as well. ALL of this is counter to standard game design and gamer instincts. That doesn \\' t make the game original and inventive, it makes information technology bad because it doesn \\' t tell you any of that. It \\' s a choose your ain adventure book that says \" make sure to read the story \" and doesn \\' t mention you can skip around. I legitimately don \\' t understand how this game has mass appeal. For fans of the genre, sure, absolutely. But a plot of the year should transcend genre. A truly amazing game is at least fun to play for a while even if you \\' re not a fan of the genre.

The devs are trying to stomp out all cheating, so the coding community has double downed and created multiple ways to bypass EAC WHILE ONLINE. Welcome to the old DS3 days of getting crashed, and softbanned without knowing your inventory was edited. The issue isn \\' t incredibly prevalent right now, but as a former CE coder for DS3 I can tell you quite easily where we are headed. Once the game drops in price, it \\' ll be overran. A lot of people now are just using whatever edits they can get away with, and some people are even buying multiple copies to ban evade. So right now it \\' s not a super invasive issue, but within a year it will be. The price drop will hit, hackers will buy up multiple copies, and the harassment will begin. Do you remember frame DCed? Do you remember the crashes so bad that you had to restart your PC? Do you remember being teleported into a room, with no way out, and all your bonfires disabled? We are heading that direction. It \\' s inevitable no matter what they do with the AC, but now the devs are trying to ban anyone, and everyone who uses any sort of edit of any kind. I don \\' t see harm in people editing their level for PvP, and I don \\' t see issues with people creating new builds via CE editing (changing bullet values so you can use boss spells, or spells that are hidden within the code) A lot of this is really cool, and we even made a community in DS3 to prevent blackhats from ruining our fightclubs. We \\' d have an omega hacker defending the fight club, crashing anyone he detected as a blackhat. Now? Nobody wants to defend anymore, and you can still be force invaded at any time. There \\' s no way to defend yourself unless you want to catch a ban. I personally ran countercheats to crash hackers if they messed with me. Now? Defending myself will net me a ban. Now let \\' s talk about the game. This is by far the hardest \" souls \" game to be released, the threads complaining about everything after you reach the point of no return, are numerous. The ultra super special boss, even popular streamers are saying shes boring, and the only way to win is to remember her combos perfectly. No variation to that fight, if you try to get some space, rush combo, if you try to position, rush combo. It \\' s just playing 100% defense and hoping you can land occasional hits. If she manages to hit you, she heals. So that \\' s fun. Outside the last 4 or 5 bosses, the game is great. Once you hit that endgame it \\' s like the Berlin wall, won \\' t come down for some time. The majority of players I talk to are gated after or right before Fire Giant. The game RAMPS incredibly hard during that period, where a fully kitted, max level, max stat character can still be 2 shotted. How do you suppose those fights go for anyone around 140? The recommended level. It doesn \\' t, seen too many people whine about difficulty, and quit. I personally agree, the late game ramps just a little too hard, and relies on mechanics that are just not fun. I \\' d rather play bloodborne, or DS3 any day. Most people who disagree with my opinion, also follow with \" GIT GUD LOL BAD SCRUB \" Yet, I \\' m not seeing as many as I act during DS3, maybe it \\' s because that game was actually average? Only 33% of players have beat that super hard boss that Iodin was talking about early on, and 19% of players have even beat the game. Some people say that the last two bosses of the story, are harder than anything else. I personally think that the secret boss is the hardest boss I \\' ve ever beat legit. This is coming from someone who soloed the bloodborne DLC with no deaths from the bosses. Soloed all the souls games except this one, there must be something wrong here right? Food for thought.

The Great runes are largely meaningless and their effects are abysmal for the effort of finding and climbing the right tower. 10% more max hp is as good as it gets. it feels like they quickly jammed this stuff in just to advertise it as a feature instead of actually making it a feature. the open world is the emptiest and loneliest world i have ever been in.

IT IS BROKEN! bosses are either impossible or trivial depending on your playstyle for instance. if your plan is to do the classic swing swing damage strat. you are sure to beleive that this game is hard. thats because boss IA is reading your inputs and even your queued inputs including rolling and flasks. even worse, bosses are able to cancel attacks or animations with eachother. this combination of mechanics basically creates bosses who truly NEVER STOP ATTACKING. if you keep rolling the boss will keep trying to quickly punish it by starting a new attack string. if you dodge that he will just do it againagain until it lands a hit thus actually letting it continue its intended attack string. every death in this game can be summed up with \" oh i thought they were done. \" some bosses are able to cancel their own hitstun! yeah thats insanely broken! theres another weird interaction where sometimes if you poise break a boss while its attacking it will suddenly be doing the attack when they recover. for instance. falling star beasts charge can be interupted by hitting it in the head. letting you get some hits in. just when it gets up it will suddenly resume the charge full speed with no warnings. commander niall has a massive Aoe attack that he has to charge up first. if you break his stance during the charge up and reposte him. after he gets back up he will suddenly be doing his massive Aoe with you stood right adjacent to him. there is no way this is intended game design! theres humiliated shit like this but also the player can just use any straight sword and spam square off the entire game. AND THAT WORKS! margit will have his poise broken after 2 uses. this game is such a fuckin mess! !! AND IT GOT GAME OF THE YEAR wtf! ? this only scratches the surface of shit thats wrong. this game is carried so hard by everyone \\' s hype. its really just a $ 60 roblox experience with somehow worse PvP. for the love of god start criticizing games again people! just because miyazaki and martin made it doesnt mean its automatically good. no game should be exempt from actual criticism in the way this game has been for the last year. like seriously guys. fanboys praise this game for shit done in the 90s. wowies it took over 10 years to program horses. is this just a big joke im not a part of or something?',\n",

Being forced to play where a controller design is intended is very annoying to me. The game world is vast, and beautiful, and fun to explore. Enemies look interesting. The atmosphere is great. Those are the only pluses I would attribute to Elden Ring. Combat ruins the game however, in my opinion. The camera control is lousy and locked targets will switch mid - combat to targets you are not even engaged with. It is always fun fighting an enemy directly in front of you and having the camera rotate 180 degrees because it randomly locks some enemy behind you. At that point, you make up still facing and fighting the front enemy but with the camera spinning, missing all your attacks, and not even knowing which manner is upward or down after the vertigo the game puts you through. Every fight is painful and it is not because of how the enemy fights most of the time, but rather, it is because of how lousy the controls are with keyboard and mouse. I also believe in fair combat for games, with a decent AI. Elden Ring is anything but this. Once you start going into boss fights, all they do is stay on you with either their 10x speed movement, or jump onto you from the other side of the arena. Your character is very sluggish in comparison. Not only is enemy boss movement at super speed, merely they do not have status bars themselves, other than HP, so they spam boss abilities. To me, I find information technology to be a cheaty and lousy AI. It \\' s non really about tactics but more about learning the rotations and timings. The AI is just not good. A lot of people say \" git gud \" but I think that should be directed at these companies for not developing any kind of decent AI in these games and just going with the same old worn - out model every single time. This game feels like a step backwards. Rather of meaningful combat, this game is all about timing that dodge roll. I find it sad that games have not progressed beyond parkour and the dodge roll. >. >',\n",

Elden Ring has proved itself to be a huge disappointment and in many areas still a shitshow, especially from the PVP side of things. here is a list of things that don ' t sit well with me: - too much unbalanced and broken stuff geared towards the casual players that can use that to insta - kill without any skill needed for execution. All thanks to the needy - greedy content creators on youtube the game is at all times infested by users of the same OP shit. - Implementing jumping along with jumping attacks was a huge mistake for pvp. They are way too safe with added i - frames, deal too much damage and don ’ t price much stamina. Especially terrible on dual curved sword users with bleed that hit 4 times in one jump. - Fighting system resolves around jump attacks, weapon art spam and whatever else broken mechanics the game currently has to offer to make a casual feel like a god without any skill requirement whatsoever. A nightmare when facing ganks. - Huge lack of variety in movesets between weapons. - Lots of movesets part are redundant. It was so nice to see additional moves and maneuvers, but you quickly notice after a while that a lot of them are pointless. I also really missed the heavy chain continuity pattern after a roll from DS3 in which you would actually do the second attack right away and not the first that you would do from neutral. - Invasions are incredibly host favored with them having all their flasks and on top of that at least one or two friends with them. Single hosts can only be invaded if they specifically> invite <invaders. .. - _ - - Invading near / far is good, but getting back your runes is a pull, especially since the marker on the map is easily overseeable. - Implementing sneaking was nice, but being able to spam it and hence teabag other people only promotes toxicity (some people are even so lazy that they use it for bowing smh ). - Shallow implementation. You can just run past everything. Nothing ever really stands in your way except very few gate keeper bosses. There is no reason to actually fight the creatures around you - none whatsoever. The world is empty and shallow. Exploring solitary sites seldomly bears anything as reward. - Late game areas are poorly designed and don ' t provide anything really worthwhile for exploring. - ng + and beyond is pointless unless you need a specific item that you missed in a quest or that you want to have a second time. - bosses represent ridiculously easy when fighting in a group. Since you can also summon spirits you can make it also incredibly easy offline. - Boss design is nowhere near DS3 level (which were challenging, fun and had incredible soundtrack ). Some bosses are lackluster and bring in unfair mechanics to raise the difficulty artificially. The final bosses are all terrible in that regard. Beatable sure, but no fun fight really. Other bosses are usually just copy pasta variants of what you have fought before. There are actually only quite a few unique bosses. The OSTs of the bosses is not really noteworthy. Radagon ’ s fight theme is the only memorable and great piece (as it is basically the main theme ). - Terrible camera that will get you killed. For instance when close to walls or when facing giant / gigantic foes (looking at you fire giant!) - Most players get items duped from the getgo which destroys any early game natural balances the game originally had. Nothing has been done on that front – ever so. - High level players with later game equipment are often summoned and act like guard dog on steroids. Downleveling does not work well in this game at all. Damage - wise they melt anything in their way. GG From Soft. .. - when you die to a night opponent you have to set the day time to night everytime AND sit at the site of grace again to them spawn again. So much wasted time. - Overall unfortunately the replayability of this game is scarce. Too much copy pasta content (lots of sekiro stuff including OSTs to a fault ), too many lackluster obstacles, too few actual rewards that give incentive to proceed to ng + This is the first From Software Game I am not sure whether or not I actually would want to buy the DLC if released.\",\n",

If you play without spirits, you often have to dodge the boss for 20 - 30 seconds before you finally get an opportunity to get a hit in and go back to dodging for 30 seconds. The bosses miss a serious back and forth aspect, and that makes the fights very unsatisfying. This is without mentioning that bosses will randomly add attacks to the end of combo strings that seem \" safe. \" Thus, the fight basically requires rote memorization through trial and error to understand which boss attacks are truly \" safe \" to respond to with an attack. If you act with spirits, the bosses become extremely easy and you essentially just abuse the enemy ai flaws. For a series known for its bosses, this biz has very few fun boss fights. The next biggest problem is the open world. While the worldly concern is somewhat fun to explore in your first playthrough, the loot often feels spread way too thin compared to past games because unlike past soulsborne games, Elden Ring is an open world game. You often find crap that is irrelevant to your build waiting to find something that may finally get you to change weapons / armor / spells.

Compared to nearly every other From Software game except maybe Demons Souls or Dark Souls 2, Elden Ring is outshone in nearly every conceivable way. The combat is just unsatisfying, the npcs are some of the worst in the series, and the open earth aspect just does not work in the context of a souls - like game. The visual design in this game in general, except for maybe a few specific examples, is just unlikable in a way that makes areas not as interesting as previous games. Elden Ring has discrepant design philosophies which make the game feel unnecessarily frustrating at times. The game is filled with gank fights and unnecessary annoyances. A distant ledge that looks to be part of a wall could lead to a secret or may be blocked by an invisible wall that causes you to fall to your death. The game feels like it was made by people who had no communication with each other. The game also suffers from copy and paste, cookie cutter, pre - fabbed dungeons which comprise of nearly all of the games side content. In these dungeons you may find an interesting boss, but it most certainly also appears in at least 3 other dungeons and the reward leave likely be not worth the effort you put into the dungeon.

Just to make clear, I do like and enjoy FromSoftware \\' s works. So all respect for Miyazaki and his team. And I like the secret plan, even though to me it is more or less just Dark Souls 4. Will most likely still play more and finish ER at somepoint. But since there be no \" Mixed \" review I \\' ll afford a thumbs down. If you liked previous soulsgames and are fan of the genre, then most likely you \\' ll find something to enjoy from here too. If you are new to soulslikes, then this might not be your cup of tea. (To add that I wasn \\' t really on the hype train waiting for ER, was more less \" might as well buy for shits and giggles \" and for me it has paid itself back.) FS has proven time and time again that they can make great worlds with interesting areas, but on Elden Ring, I personally feel that some of the magic was lost due to the shift of open world. I think that From is more strong when building interconnected labyrinths like the ones in Bloodborne and Dark Souls 1 to compare. In ER they \\' ve managed to do this the Legacy set pieces very nicely. They are straight up comparable to previous works of FS. The world is pretty, but pretty alone doesn \\' t make it good. Even with all the vistas and PoI \\' s the world at times feels empty and recycled (Though recycling in ER is a problem in itself at times) and after a while you won \\' t be spending that much time on the map itself anymore since fast travel makes travelling on Torrent obsolete. I think that ER provides a fair challenge when compared to other soulsborne games, the difficulty is on par and the option of being able to do something else when facing a wall is a nice addition even though you \\' ve always had the ability to go back and grind (if one chooses so) unless you wanted to throw yourself against that wall till it breaks.',\n",

I have played DS1 from many different angles and many different classes, but have never seen the appeal. To me, playing these games just feels like training yourself to be really good at executing a half - baked feedback loop process with extremely broken tools, and Elden Ring is no exception. Not only does this game exemplify everything wrong with the design of FROM games, but it doesn \\' t even do it in an original or groundbreaking way like lots of people would have you believe. The combat is almost exactly like DS1, and the bosses are an odd loan blend of styles and presentation from Soul, Bloodborne, and Sekiro. The open world is lifeless and dull, and the game dumps needlessly obtuse exposition with no explanation of other parts of the lore or why you as the player should care. It \\' s just \" go on a great quest, oh chosen Undead! \" Yeah, I haven \\' t seen that anywhere else. .. except it \\' s the premise for every FROM game since Dark Souls. Truly I am absolutely baffled as to how this game won any awards, much less Game of the Year. If you want a video game that you can install, have fun with, and put down until you wanna play again, this is NOT the game for you. If you like games where you have to sink an extreme amount of time and research into the world \\' s lore, the broken combat system, and the general obtuse and bloated design of the game in hopes that you MIGHT be capable of squeezing out even the smallest crumbs of fun from it, then be my guest here. Hopefully I can at least get a refund so I can say I spent my money on a game I will actually play instead of a game that I boot up, play for 5 minutes, be reminded why I didn \\' t buy at launch, die due to broken hit detection, and turn off again for 3 or 4 more weeks. Maybe I \\' m old school, but I think video games should be fun right out of the box. Part of the reason I love PC gaming specifically is because there is so much variety to be had in terms of game experiences, whether in terms of \" pick up and play \" or \" big time sink \" type games like this one. And that is definitely not to say that all games that require you to put time and research into them are bad; some of my favorite games are Stalker, Silent Hill, and Disco Elysian fields, all games that require you to retain and put effort into the world and just being in the game.

Or does everything in this game ultimately serve as but fluff in between hours of grinding that you \\' re expected to just enjoy without any clear motivation as to why you should be enjoying it? And even then, when the story DOES show up, it \\' s the exact same pseudo - verbose fake Tolkien crap FROM have been spoon - feeding their blood - loyal fans since Dark Souls.

I can tell this is a game that would be one of my favorites of all fourth dimension, due to some areas being less demanding and running well.

If there was a mixed option, I ' five hundred pick it, but there isn ' t so I can ' t.

I have tried to the best of my ability to play through it, but I just can ' t in good faith recommend this to anyone on the fence about if their computer can handle it. I have non had performance nearly this bad in any other Fromsoft game. The minimum performance specs list below are a lie and in reality you want a computer much better than that for it to run acceptably. They really need to do better on these ports or at least list their specs more accurately. EDIT: I managed to get more reliable and acceptable performance by editing my registry to boost the game ' s CPU priority. This is still a negative review since you should not have to mess with your registry to change CPU priority. Lmao. After having beaten the game due to being able to not play in a world of slowed time, I can really say this game is incredible, though, so take this review as a recommendation if your computer is significantly better than minimum specs.

Pros: Level design, character design, environment art, music: all of these are top - tier and will keep you going throughout a very long journey. Cons: People confuse obfuscation with mystery and bad UX with challenge. To complete this game, you will have to consult a wiki. Not because it is hard (which it is) but because they do very little to tell you where your objectives are. Perhaps they expect you to endlessly wander around the world in hopes you bump into that NPC again. If they put them on the critical path line, maybe that would happen but it is often only in a random spot. That isn ' t serendipity; it ' s just being opaque. Maybe the nonsense story would make a bit of good sense if information was organized or if there was a basic quest tracker. I don ' t need a bunch of UI elements to tell me exactly where something is, precisely try and respect the player a little bit. Did you know that you essentially have to upgrade HP more than any other stat or you will be one - shotted by nearly everything in the game? Would be nice to know, especially since you can only recast your stats halfway - ish through with the game. Speaking of respecting the player, if you are going to be tough as nails, you have to be spotlessly bug free. Unfortunately, attacks go through solid objects at random and frame drops will eat your tiffin at the worst possible times. There ' s little joy when you eventually succeed; just relief that an annoying element is done. Luckily, you can often scramble bosses by tricking the AI or leveraging a bug in the environment so I guess two can play at that game. And who decided that this game where the character rightly feels like he is wearing forty pounds of armor should be a platformer? I ' m happy I roughed my way through it, but I can ' t see myself recommending it to anyone. It ' s an interesting game, but not what the incredibly toxic community exalts it as. It ' s a bleak game with a few truly exquisite moments outweighed by a preponderance of slog. And now I ' m finally free of it.\",\n",

Affect to an open world has absolutely killed all joy, all tension, all skill and hardship that defined the Souls series. I am completely exclusively in a bland, empty world with no noteworthy npcs, copy paste dungeons, the ability to completely invalidate entire sections of the map by accidentally leveling up (you know, playing the game) or just spawning a summon that dumpsters any boss. Open world worked in the Witcher because it had a story, and characters to do the world feel alive or at least give you a purpose for what you are doing. Not to mention that it looked and played far better with better quality of life inclusions. Riding a horse sucks, scanning the map so you don ' t miss important items or entire NPC questlines sucks. Foe design is a joke where they will literally have a seizure if you hit them too much. You can ' t compare shop items to ones equipped because this game was apparently designed in 1997.

Bulletpoints: - the combat is entertaining but unfortunately my reflexes aren \\' t as sharp as they used to be so I can \\' t say I found it particularly enjoyable. It ultimately relies way also much on grind to compensate for slower than average response times. While I understand the logic of git gud and I did invest a lot of time into the game in the end the mechanic of farming plebs for level up points un - engaging. Even if I ultimately bailed, the purist are right about no difficulty slider, and the amount of time i sunk into it shows that the gameplay loop is more than good plenty. - the story is meh, pretentious drivel or maybe it \\' s just not for pine tree state. - the atmosphere works but not really something to write home about. It wasn \\' t one of those things that had me giddy to open the game again, but maybe it \\' s just that dreary isn \\' t something I search for in my free time. By the time I realized killing dragons wasn \\' t triggering a spark of emotion I had to accept that it was clip to stop.

Elden Ring \\' s - - like the Dark Souls series before it - - is a combat system built on limitations. Every offensive and defensive option is carry out with either stamina or focus (that is, if you \\' re using magic or ashes of war.) You \\' ve also got input buffering to deal with, where button presses have a noticeable delay, and the game registers every input, which WILL lead to accidental panic rolls, drinking flasks one too many times, and doing a mistaken follow - up R2 after doing a jump attack. It \\' s a feature endlessly at odds with the committal controls. You can \\' t cancel your animations, so a good handful of player deaths are a result of people failing to account for an enemy \\' s unavoidable punisher (s) while they \\' re stuck in some animation. This wouldn \\' t be such an issue if enemies didn \\' t all have uniquely rapid combos they can chain together endlessly, and that \\' s on top of everything being way too fast and two - shotting you in the endgame. Not even just bosses, but regular enemies. Many bosses and enemies are simply designed with movesets meant to counter the \" few \" combat mechanics you have at your administration. However, I have to say \" few \" in quotes because there is a wide variety of spells in the game, along with many special attacks you can add to weapons in the form of ashes of war. If you \\' re able to find an effective combination of these things, you can trivialize a lot of the fights, but this solution highlights my principal grievance with this game. If something isn \\' t working, you \\' re not meant to adapt to an enemy until it does. You \\' re meant to trivialize the shit by min - maxing. That kind of stuff may be fun for PVP, but, unless they \\' re an invader, enemies don \\' t play by the same rules you do. All of this wouldn \\' t be such a problem if there were another angle to the gameplay, but fighting your way through the world is the only thing your character is good for, sadly. And that \\' s a real shame when you have such cool a setting with so many major characters. Imagine pledge fealty to a Shardbearer with a kneel emote in the middle of battle or something, and then you get to join their faction instead of just killing every single one of them. That \\' s the kind of shit I play RPGs for, but all you get here are fragmented questlines you need spoiler just to complete, and omniscient item descriptions. My final note: I know nothing of the game \\' s community or meta or what - have - you, but if the only way I can enjoy or beat a game is by looking up everything and playing it someone else \\' s way, then the game just ain \\' t for me.

The problem with the delays is not that they take too long it \\' s that the enemy simply stands there with their weapon up with little to no animation so you fundamentally have to see them suffice the animation and start counting, get hit and remember to how much you counted everytime they do that attack again to properly dodge information technology. This happens for the whole game, even the final boss does it. - Chain attacks are too fast sometimes. Sometimes the enemy follows an attack with another so fast that you still are on the roll animation you used to dodge the first attack, this doesn \\' t happen very often but it \\' s very frustrating when it does specially when it stunlocks you to death. - The open world is too open. This one is more personal, probably most people will love this but I can \\' t leave a geographical zone peacefully without feeling like I missed half of the things it has to put up, and this does happen, unless you use a wiki to see where everything the zone has to offer is then you will leave out dungeons, legendary armaments / magics and even NPCs with questlines.

              " 'I want to first say that I don \\' t want to recommend, or not recommend this game. For some it will be phenomenal, while for others it will be terrible, and that is just a fact. It \\' s a shame I am forced to select one or the other. Since the game exist so hyped in one direction, recommended, I guess I will do the opposite in the spirit of balance. I don \\' t get the appeal of games like this. They are TOO hard to enjoy. If you want the exploration that is expected in an RPG, you will find it here, but every chiropteran can kill you unless you also enjoy mastering combat. I don \\' t want to do anything more than press a button to swing a sword, or cast a spell, and perhaps dodge or block like you do in GW2. If you are like me then I recommend you avoid this game regardless of the rave reviews. I played this game much longer than I expected because I spent $ 60 on it, but here are the issues as I see them: Pros: 1. Exploration of the open world is really second to none. This is a fantastic open world with a mystery and excitement to it akin to Everquest 1 when it first released. 2. The variety of mobs is fairly high 3. The graphics and ambient sounds are well done 4. The first act of the game, when mobs are not ridiculous and everything is new, is simply the best experience I have had in years. Most reviews go on and on about this same thing so I won \\' t reiterate it here. What most reviews don \\' t mention are the negatives, and there are negatives for many types of players despite the thousands of positive reviews. Cons: 1. Tedious: if you die you lose all runes which are collected like gold would be in most games, but are also the only way to level; you get one shot to pick them up again, but if you die they are gone for good along with every single bit of progress you have made in earning them. Also, when you die ALL previously killed mobs respawn and you have to fight your way back through them. I despise repeating things, and this game is designed to kill you over and over so you will spend a lot of time repeating stuff. 2. There is no real sense of getting more powerful. Sure there are mobs you eventually become unattackable than, but you are always just a few unfortunate hits and stuns away from death no matter your level, experience, or gear. 3. There is no way to adjust difficulty, so if you become mentally weary of the competitiveness and just want to explore the world and story on a slighty lower intensity, you can forget it. 4. After reaching the capital you will notice that mobs move beyond challenging into the realm of being unfair. They have stuns, endless combos, ridiculous jumps, unblockable hits, and are so expectant and fast you cannot outrun them; nevermind the encounters in quests or dungeons which occur in cramped quarters where you have to master combat to have a chance. You may like to master combat, but the truth is there is luck involved in many of the boss fights, and not everyone likes the combat as much as the exploration or other things. 5. There is no quest journal to track steps completed, or even repeat goals or remind you of NPC names, or locations where you found them. That isn \\' t just not holding your hand, that is stupid and not respecting your time. 6. The story really isn \\' t very good at all. I understand that is subjective, but many players couldn \\' t tell you the story if you asked them, unless they had read it from a third party site. Even if you do know it, it is boring, and RPGs are supposed to be story - driven, so a weak or non - compelling story - line is a problem. 7. You will experience burnout if you are like many others who have stated they eventually just skip fights and run straight through zones in the endgame, just wanting to say they completed the game, and for it to be over. In fact, I \\' ve read that many, myself included, have settle to not complete the game because it has become a chore. 8. There are hidden features like using gestures to unlock hidden areas supposedly. Well, you first have to find the gestures, then find the areas to use them, and then figure verboten which one to use. I would normally like such a feature, but I find it annoying in this game. If you try the game you will see what I mean. 9. The game implements soft caps on stats to force you to diversify your build and try different things. Look, if I want to max a stat and use the same weapon the whole game, then that is my business. Stop artificially forcing me to try play - styles I don \\' t like. There is more to say, but there isn \\' t much point when a game is so highly rated. The game has real issues for certain gamers that will continue to be dismissed by the fans who say that I need to get better at the game. But you see, I don \\' t WANT to get better. I just want to enjoy the Elden Ring world using MY playstyle, not yours. This is one of the only developers that has decided they absolutely will not do that; it is their MO. I am all about developers deciding what type of game they want to make, and sticking to it. Elden Ring does that and I say good for them, but the result is a gamer like me is eventually driven away. Fans of this series are happy about that, because they are so scared the things they like will be changed, or that their bragging rights will become meaningless as more people can kill the bosses they do, but I think this is silly. There is some multiplayer functionality, but in the end this is a single player RPG and one gamer \\' s sense of accomplishment shouldn \\' t hinge on another gamer being shutout of the experience of the game to protect fragile egos and placate irrational fears. Let as many people as possible experience and enjoy the fantasy world created I say. For the reasons just stated, the game is so hyped that I believe the reviews never give you a fair assessment of the negatives, or at least the full picture. This game isn \\' t just \" not for everyone because it \\' s hard. \" This game isn \\' t for everyone because it has problems like any other. It doesn \\' t have the best gaffer fights that exist, even if that is your thing. It is a challenge, and it is well done, but there is a HUGE segment of gamers that are also wasting their time with this game because it makes ZERO allowances for them in the end. I find myself wanting to explore every nook and cranny because the world is that good, but I cannot stand the stupid boss fights and respawning of mobs anymore. It has become tiring. I cannot stand that I can \\' t turn the difficulty down if I want to. I cannot stand that the game is designed to make you repeat stuff because it wants you to die to experience a sense of accomplishment. Hey, if that \\' s you then great, but it isn \\' t me, and this game doesn \\' t take a player like me into account. I wish it did.',\n",

Good luck having any sort of success in this game without constantly having to look up guides for bosses, weapons, where to go next, etc. For some reason there is nothing to aid the player with where to go next. No log or quest tracker. Also the game is very ugly and dull to look at (compare with the vibrant and colorful environment of Ghost of Tsushima for instance ). But perhaps this is not a surprise given how dull and ugly Sekiro is as well. Personal opinion, but the game is overhyped. I purchased it on day 1 for PS5 and it never pull me in. I played it for 30 minutes, put it down until a few days later. Then I did it a couple of more times before I decided to sell the game.

First things first, if you \\' re planning to play Elden Ring as your first \" souls - like \" - please, try Dark Souls 1 instead. It \\' s an all around better game. As for this game, I can \\' t for the [i] life [/ i] of me fathom why it was so praised. Maybe I \\' m just tired of the generic \" souls \" formula, or maybe it \\' s just my MDD that keeps gets bad. But Elden Ring - in my sentiment - is by far the worst, so to say, \" souls - like \" developed by FromSoftware - Dark Souls 2 included. Now, I think the developers / designers responsible for creating the \" overworld \" map indeed did a fantastic job, and the beginning of this game was somewhat promising. Withal, other than that - Elden Ring is a creatively bankrupt, tedious, unbalanced, at some points borderline broken and worst of all - simply boring - mess. Balancing issues aside - the game \\' s main problem, I think, is that it \\' s obscenely bloated with copypasted content: - Copypasted locations - which ruined any kind of atmosphere / immersion and disincentivized any point in exploration - the strongest, so say, aspect of previous From \\' s \" souls - clones \". Even the major late - game locations are hard, if I \\' m not mistaken, the correct term is - \" asset - flipped \" versions of previous locations - and there \\' s only ~ 7 of them in the entire game. The other ~ 52 areas are just small \" mini - dungeons \". They in particular are just horrendous. Sure, you get some kind of - usually worthless - item at the end of yet another Cave / Crypt (that \\' s all there is to it to the variety ). But everything looks exactly the same - what was even the point? I mean, it would \\' ve been nice if the combat system wasn \\' t so repetitive, but unfortunately - it is. Even Bloodborne did it better with its random Chalice Dungeons. - Copypasted enemies. In comparison with From \\' s previous titles, in which each area usually had an array of unique enemy types, Elden Ring exhausts most of its, so to say, bestiary in barely ~ 1. 5 - 3 hours of gameplay. After that, it \\' s, once again - just the same exact mobs that exponentially turn into obnoxious damage - sponges. And it actually doesn \\' t help that quite a lot of creatures (and player \\' s character) repurpose animations assets from From \\' s previous games - mostly Dark Souls 3. - Majority of bosses (a lot of which were reused as regular enemy mobs) were also haphazardly copypasted. And all the story - bosses felt completely unimaginative, forgettable and, with exception to a couple of end - game ones - trivial. I even bothered to stop leveling at some point and used a guide on how to NOT get accidentally overpowered - which is an easy thing to do, because this game has a rather broken progression system. The battle content designers, also, seem to have ran out of ideas and made the main knob rely on cheap \" delayed \" attacks, annoying lingering AOEs and 1 - shot gimmicks - particularly towards the very end of the game. Which, in my opinion, made this game into the most \" sluggish \" one in the series, despite added jump move from Sekiro - especially for melee characters. Magic is completely overpowered, by the way - I refuse to believe it was thoroughly playtested. One of the bosses, in particular - \" Malenia, The Meme of This Game \" - was clearly not designed for Elden Ring \\' s combat system at all. Honestly, just google it. It \\' s really unfortunate that they messed up that badly - especially after aforementioned Sekiro, which had amazing bosses and an even better combat system in general. Well, to spout at least something positive - I \\' d say Radahn (a giant goofball on a small horse) - one of the main mid - game bosses, was pretty decent because developers for once actually tried something unique with this one. .. and he also looked memorably amusing. But overall, I didn \\' t like Elden Ring. I think it \\' s a barely mediocre game and It \\' s really quite a shame that it wasn \\' t criticized into oblivion - like Dark Souls 2, for example. And as an another little side note to those who for some reason liked PvP in previous games, even though I \\' m in no position to talk about it. Due to severe balancing issues - PvP here is objectively broken, there \\' s no faction system and invasion - mechanic is also fairly \" strange \" too. According to developers, to make invaders less of an issue for players - it \\' s now only possible to invade ganks / groups. I think it just encouraged the use of broken builds and twinking. And for some absurd reason invading someone during a boss battle is also possible and, I should add, there \\' s an easily accessible suicide bomb flask which can 1 - shot majority of players (was kind of entertaining a couple of times ).

              "       \"I write this review as I have 100% completed Elden Ring. And yet, despite this, I still find new things every time I play the game.\\n\\nElden Ring is an experience to say the least, and I won't be dramatic and say it is life changing but it feels like this is THE video game to play if you're ever going to play a game. It's immersive and full of story, every little thing is made with such refined detail that you can easily miss the little things. Everything feels so interconnected and it is so easy to get lost and find yourself on an adventure.\\nIt's been a long time since I've felt like a game really wanted me to just... go explore and have fun with the world. It feels punishing but no punishment in this game goes unrewarded.\\n\\nHere's my breakdown of the game, I'll try not to spoil but I'll post spoiler warnings just in case.\\n\\n*Story*:\\n\\nAs any Fromsoft game is, the world is vague and extremely open ended. Which can be a huge mess if done wrong but this is done entirely right. Story is not handed to you on a silver platter, however if you do wish to go find it through character storylines, you're given plenty of exposition and development. Characters are made to make you care about them or hate them. A lot.\\nWhere Elden Ring shines is the characters that they weave into the story and how important bosses feel to kill due to story context. The context you are given bit by bit really sell your journey.\\n\\n*The Endings*:\\n\\n(I have not done Golden Mask or Dungeater's ending as they do not really interest me too much. Do note there are spoilers up ahead so skip this section if you don't want that)\\n\\n-Ranni's Ending was actually one of the most satisfying endings to a Souls game I've seen in a long time. She was a compelling character and her roster of companions feel fun and diverse in their own ways. They take you on this meaningful journey with twists and questionable moral choices. And to wrap it all up nicely after taking you underground to Nokron, Fromsoft has you revisiting areas previously to ground you in Ranni's backstory via Liurnia.\\nI 100% recommend getting this ending and I'll be posting a guide soon!\\n\\n-Frenzy Flame Ending was... something? It wasn't exactly remarkable but I did really enjoy the voice acting! I can't say the way to get it was entertaining though, go through some sewers, comet azur Mohg, and take 5 minutes to jump on some graves and now you have an ending only 15% of people this game have. It didn't feel satisfying but it was visually neat and the eyes look really radical.\\n\\n-Elden Lord. Nuff said, you become elden lord. A decent neutral ending!\\n\\n-Fia's. This one was actually really mysterious and fun. Full of deceit and conflict. You don't get an achievement with this alas but it's worth doing. Fun bosses, neat story, Fia being based.\\n\\n\\n*Gameplay*\\n\\nIt takes some getting used to. I grew up on the souls games and I am used to fast paced movements. But I really had to be patient with this one! Lots of delay which forces you to pay attention to the details of certain bosses. Also adding jumping in with some of the mechanics was really neat! Albeit a bit annoying from time to time (Cough, Godfrey, Cough).\\n\\nThe dungeons and caves are plenty of fun and remind me of old legend of zelda mechanics. The bosses are fun and engaging, always on your toes. Although Rennala was a slight bore phase 1.\\nYou can take your time or zoom through the Main Story. Going back to back in the story takes around 2-4 hours. But there's so much to do in the game that it might take you 100+ hours to even complete it.\\n\\n\\nSo, yeah. Play it.\",\n",

              "       'I do not understand why the game is so hyped, if this be what a \" game of the year \" is, I am loosing my hopes. The game was clearly made for consoles and porting the user user interface and controls to PC was probably done by accident or an working student, but this is not the main problem. The controls are flawed even with a controller, for example there is no walking backwards or sideways which makes hitting enemies unnecessarily hard. The game concept is so swallow: Loot, Level, Kill. .. why? Because of a indoctrinating lengthy intro video at the start of game which spoon feds you the \" why \" in the fashion of a online training video about the new corporate culture. After this you a set free into a beautify looking, but empty feeling, open world with bare minimum physics and half brain dead AI. .. and for that you better pull out your reading glasses, because you are going to read a lot of tool tips trying to excuse the non - intuitive menu. From this point on wards there is not much more going on that to loot, level, and kill poorly scripted AI that judge to kill you for no good reason. For me this game has nothing to offer, because its just a grind for the sake of grinding without any real reward. Single would refund it if I would not have bought it with a discount from a 3rd party. TL; DR: Nothing is interesting beside the pretty game engine. Would refund if I had not bought a key from a 3rd party.',\n",
